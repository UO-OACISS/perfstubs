class Perfstubs(Package):
    """Profiling API for adding external tool instrumentation support to any project.

This was motivated by the need to quickly add instrumentation to the
[ADIOS2](https://github.com/ornladios/ADIOS2) library without adding a build
dependency, or tying to a specific measurement tool.

The initial prototype implementation was tied to TAU, but evolved to this more
generic version, which was extracted as a separate repository for testing and
demonstration purposes.
